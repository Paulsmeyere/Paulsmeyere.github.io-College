		<p>
				I am attending the University of Missouri to get and agribusiness management degree. I want to be able<br>
				to use this degree to help on our farm and help my brothers run our produce business. But, while getting<br>
				this degree I want to explore other careers and classes in college to broaden my knowledge and confirm<br>
				that agribusiness is the degree that I want.
